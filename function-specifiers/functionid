# functionID()

`functionID` keyword allows assigning function identifier explicitly.
Each public function has a unique 32-bit identifier (id). id 0 is reserved for [receive](#receive) function.
In case `functionID` is not defined explicitly, it is calculated as a hash of the function signature.
In general, there is no purpose to set the function id manually.

Example:

```solidity
function f() public pure functionID(123) {
    /*...*/
}
 ```
