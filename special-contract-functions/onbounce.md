# onBounce

```solidity
onBounce(TvmSlice body) external {
    /*...*/
}
```

`onBounce` function is executed when contract receives a bounced inbound internal message.
The message is generated by the network if the contract sends an internal message with `bounce: true` and either

* called contract doesn't exist;
* called contract fails at the storage/credit/computing phase (not at the action phase!)

The message is generated only if the remaining message value is enough for sending one back.

`body` is empty or contains at most **256** data bits of the original message (without references).
The function id takes **32** bits and parameters can take at most **224** bits.
It depends on the network config. If `onBounce` function is not defined then the contract does
nothing on receiving a bounced inbound internal message.

If the `onBounce` function throws an exception then another bounced messages are not generated.

Example of how to use `onBounce` function:
