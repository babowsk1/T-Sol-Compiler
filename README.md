# Introduction

T-Sol, also known as Threaded Solidity, is a powerful high-level functional programming language. It inherits the widely-used syntax of classic Solidity in EVM networks while unlocking additional functionality provided by Everscale and other TVM networks. T-Sol empowers developers with features such as concurrent computations, asynchronous execution, and specialized TVM primitives, expanding the capabilities beyond traditional Solidity.

As an integral part of the T-Sol compiler, this T-Sol Compiler API documentation was initially developed by the EverX team. Leveraging our practical experience at [Broxus](https://broxus.com) and with a focus on enhancing the user experience and ease of navigation for TVM developers, we have taken the initiative to reorganize and improve the documentation, hosting it on our subdomain as a mirror.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this resource serves as your primary reference for exploring the full range of functionalities offered by the T-Sol compiler. While we have made every effort to preserve the original content, it's important to note that for the most up-to-date information, we highly recommend referring to EverX's [official documentation](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler/blob/master/API.md).

T-Sol retains the majority of the familiar Solidity syntax. In the event that you don't find documentation for certain specific features, we recommend referring to the original [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/). This will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the shared syntax and help you leverage the full potential of T-Sol.

## Navigation

This resource is organized based on different compiler versions. Keep in mind that some methods might behave differently or become outdated across versions, so make sure to choose the right compiler version from the top.

Remember, this resource focuses only on **stable** compiler versions. If you don't see a version in the dropdown, it's probably best to avoid using it.

In the left-hand sections, you'll find explanations of the crucial parts of the language, including syntax and usage examples.

Towards the end of the documentation, you'll find a changelog that highlights the major changes made in the selected version.

Feel free to provide feedback on each page and let us know if it was helpful. You can also propose changes by editing the original GitHub file. We appreciate your contributions to improving this resource!
