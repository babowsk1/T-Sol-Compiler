# Pragmas

`pragma` keyword is used to enable certain compiler features or checks.
A pragma directive is always local to a source file, so you have to add
the pragma to all your files if you want to enable it in your whole project.
If you import another file, the pragma from that file is not
automatically applied to the importing file.
