# Special contract functions

## receive

`receive` function is called in two cases:

1. [msg.data](#msgdata) (or message body) is empty.
2. [msg.data](#msgdata) starts with 32-bit zero. Then message body may contain data,
for example [string](#string) with comment.

If in the contract there is no `receive` function then the contract has an implicit empty `receive`
function.

```solidity
// file sink.sol
contract Sink {
    uint public counter = 0;
    uint public msgWithPayload = 0;
    receive() external {
        ++counter;
        // if the inbound internal message has payload then we can get it using `msg.data`
        TvmSlice s = msg.data;
        if (!s.empty()) {
            ++msgWithPayload;
        }
    }
}

// file bomber.sol
contract Bomber {
    // This function send tons 3 times to the Sink contract. Sink's function receive will handle 
    // that messages.
    function f(address addr) pure public {
        tvm.accept();
        addr.transfer({value: 1 ton}); // message's body is empty

        TvmBuilder b;
        addr.transfer({value: 1 ton, body: b.toCell()}); // message's body is empty, too

        b.store(uint32(0), "Thank you for the coffee!");
        // body of the message contains 32-bit zero number and the string
        addr.transfer({value: 20 ton, body: b.toCell()});
    }
}
```

## fallback

`fallback` function is called on receiving an inbound internal/external message in such cases:

1. The message contains a function id that the contract doesn't contain.
2. Bit-length of the message is from 1 to 31 (including).
3. Bit-length of the message is equal to zero, but the message contains reference(s).

**Note**: if the message has correct function id but invalid encoded function parameters then
the transaction fail with an exception (e.g. [cell underflow exception](#tvm-exception-codes)).

If in the contract there is no fallback function then contract has implicit fallback function
that throws [exception](#solidity-runtime-errors).

Example:

```solidity
// file ContractA.sol
contract ContractA {
    uint public counter = 0;

    function f(uint a, uint b) public pure { /*...*/ }

    fallback() external {
        ++counter;
    }

}

// file ContractB.sol
import "ContractA.sol";
import "ContractAnother.sol";

contract ContractB {
    // Let's condider that `addr` is ContractA's address. 4 messages are send. ContractA's fallback
    // function will handle that messages except the last one.
    function g(address addr) public pure {
        tvm.accept();
        // The message contains a function id that the contract doesn't contain.
        // There is wrong casting to ContractAnother. `addr` is ContractA's address.
        ContractAnother(addr).sum{value: 1 ton}(2, 2);

        {
            TvmBuilder b;
            b.storeUnsigned(1, 1);
            // Bit-length of the message is equal to 20 bits.
            addr.transfer({value: 2 ton, body: b.toCell()});
        }

        {
            TvmBuilder b;
            b.storeRef(b);
            // Bit-length of the message is equal to zero but the message contains one reference.
            addr.transfer({value: 1 ton, body: b.toCell()});
        }

        TvmBuilder b;
        uint32 id = tvm.functionId(ContractA.f);
        b.store(id, uint(2));
        // ContractA's fallback function won't be called because the message body doesn't contain
        // the second ContractA.f's parameter. It will cause cell underflow exception in ContractA.
        addr.transfer({value: 1 ton, body: b.toCell()});
    }
}
```

## onBounce

```solidity
onBounce(TvmSlice body) external {
    /*...*/
}
```

`onBounce` function is executed when contract receives a bounced inbound internal message.
The message is generated by the network if the contract sends an internal message with `bounce: true` and either

* called contract doesn't exist;
* called contract fails at the storage/credit/computing phase (not at the action phase!)

The message is generated only if the remaining message value is enough for sending one back.

`body` is empty or contains at most **256** data bits of the original message (without references).
The function id takes **32** bits and parameters can take at most **224** bits.
It depends on the network config. If `onBounce` function is not defined then the contract does
nothing on receiving a bounced inbound internal message.

If the `onBounce` function throws an exception then another bounced messages are not generated.

Example of how to use `onBounce` function:

* [onBounceHandler](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/solidity/16_onBounceHandler.sol)

## onTickTock

`onTickTock` function is executed on tick/tock transaction.
These transactions are automatically generated for certain special accounts.
For tick transactions **isTock** is false, for tock transactions - true.

Prototype:

```solidity
onTickTock(bool isTock) external {
    /*...*/
}
```

## onCodeUpgrade

`onCodeUpgrade` function can have an arbitrary set of arguments and should be
executed after [tvm.setcode()](#tvmsetcode) function call. In this function
[tvm.resetStorage()](#tvmresetstorage) should be called if the set of state
variables is changed in the new version of the contract. This function implicitly
calls [tvm.commit()](#tvmcommit). `onCodeUpgrade` function does not return value. `onCodeUpgrade` function
finishes TVM execution with exit code 0.

Prototype:

```solidity
function onCodeUpgrade(...) private {
    /*...*/
}
```

Function `onCodeUpgrade` had function id = 2 (for compiler <= 0.65.0). Now, it has another id, but you can set 
`functionID(2)` in new contracts for the `onCodeUpgrade` to upgrade old ones.

See example of how to upgrade code of the contract:

* [old contract](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/solidity/12_BadContract.sol)
* [new contract](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/solidity/12_NewVersion.sol)

It's good to pass `TvmCell cell` to the public function that calls `onCodeUpgrade(TvmCell cell, ...)`
function. `TvmCell cell` may contain some data that may be useful for the new contract.

```solidity
// old contract
// Public function that changes the code and takes some cell
function updateCode(TvmCell newcode, TvmCell cell) public pure checkPubkeyAndAccept {
    tvm.setcode(newcode);
    tvm.setCurrentCode(newcode);
    // pass cell to new contract
    onCodeUpgrade(cell);
}

function onCodeUpgrade(TvmCell cell) private pure {
}


// new contract
function onCodeUpgrade(TvmCell cell) private pure {
    // new code can use cell that was passed from the old version of the contract
}
```

## afterSignatureCheck

```solidity
function afterSignatureCheck(TvmSlice body, TvmCell message) private inline returns (TvmSlice) {
    /*...*/
}
```

`afterSignatureCheck` function is used to define custom replay protection function instead of the
default one.

NB: Do not use [tvm.commit()](#tvmcommit) or [tvm.accept()](#tvmaccept) in this function as it called before the constructor call.
**time** and **expire** header fields can be used for replay protection and, if set, they should be read in `afterSignatureCheck`.
See also: [Contract execution](#contract-execution).
See an example of how to define this function:

* [Custom replay protection](https://github.com/tonlabs/samples/blob/master/solidity/14_CustomReplayProtection.sol)
