# Executor result codes

During your interactions with contract methods, you might encounter unexpected result codes generated by the [ever-executor](https://github.com/tonlabs/ever-executor/tree/master). While it is not directly associated with the T-Sol compiler, we believe it would be helpful to include these codes here for transparency and your convenience.

```
const RESULT_CODE_ACTIONLIST_INVALID:            i32 = 32;
const RESULT_CODE_TOO_MANY_ACTIONS:              i32 = 33;
const RESULT_CODE_UNKNOWN_OR_INVALID_ACTION:     i32 = 34;
const RESULT_CODE_INCORRECT_SRC_ADDRESS:         i32 = 35;
const RESULT_CODE_INCORRECT_DST_ADDRESS:         i32 = 36;
const RESULT_CODE_NOT_ENOUGH_GRAMS:              i32 = 37;
const RESULT_CODE_NOT_ENOUGH_EXTRA:              i32 = 38;
const RESULT_CODE_INVALID_BALANCE:               i32 = 40;
const RESULT_CODE_BAD_ACCOUNT_STATE:             i32 = 41;
const RESULT_CODE_ANYCAST:                       i32 = 50;
const RESULT_CODE_NOT_FOUND_LICENSE:             i32 = 51;
const RESULT_CODE_UNSUPPORTED:                   i32 = -1;
```
