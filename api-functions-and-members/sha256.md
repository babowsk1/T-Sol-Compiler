# sha256

```solidity
// (1)
sha256(TvmSlice slice) returns (uint256)
// (2)
sha256(bytes b) returns (uint256)
// (3)
sha256(string str) returns (uint256)
```

1. Computes the SHA-256 hash. If the bit-length of `slice` is not divisible by eight, throws a cell underflow [exception](api-functions-and-members.md#tvm-exception-codes). References of `slice` are not used to compute the hash. Only data bits located in the root cell of `slice` are used.
2. Computes the SHA-256 hash only for the first 127 bytes. If `bytes.length > 127` then `b[128], b[129], b[130] ...` elements are ignored.
3. Same as for `bytes`: only the first 127 bytes are taken into account.

See also [tvm.hash()](api-functions-and-members.md#tvmhash) to compute representation hash of the whole tree of cells.
